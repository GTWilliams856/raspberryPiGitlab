A breif overview of how the installation was validated to be correct:


Build:
Upon build and transfer of image to the target should the file:
/opt/gitlab/version-manifest.txt
Should exist and the directory populated with gitlab embedded files.

Repository use:
A user should able to add a file to a repository on the target. The target should then contain that file on the SD card.
This should be done by connecting an eithernet cable to the raspberry pi and interacting with the target using the firefox web
browser to upload a file.
